# Sensor Data Frontend ðŸ–¥

 Made with Nextjs, React, and Chakra-UI. 
 This is part of the Sensor Data project where we have a dashboard showcasing charts and tables with information that is being sent through a ESP32 remotely.
 
 We have three different repositories for each chunk of the application: one for the backend, responsible for storing and retrieving data. The embedded part, where we process and send sensor data to the backend. And here, where where we aim to make a dashboard with resposive web pages with charts and tables for data visualisation.
